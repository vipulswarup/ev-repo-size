ev-reposize
===========
This project builds a dashlet to display the size of the Alfresco Repository stores, indexes, index backups and available disk space on the user's dashboard. 
It is broken down into two projects :
	1. reposize-repo
	2. reposize-share

This project is a copy of work from **Chris Paul** hosted on [Github!](https://github.com/cmpaul/reposize). It has been modified to use Alfresco Maven SDK 2.1.0 and built on top of Alfresco 5.0.d.
